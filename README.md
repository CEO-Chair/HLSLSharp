# HLSLSharp

HLSLSharp is a .NET library that allows you to compile and run C# code on the GPU through HLSL and D3D11. It is inspired by [ComputeSharp](https://github.com/Sergio0694/ComputeSharp) and based on [cshlsl](https://github.com/steviegt6/cshlsl).

## Installation

Currently, you can only build the project from source. I plan to make a NuGet package available in the future.
